                Hi! My name is Brittani (Britt) and I was born and raised in Austin, Texas. I went to school at UT in Austin where I studied
                biology and played volleyball on the club team. I have a Masters in marine biology from Texas A&M in Galveston.
                After school I studied environmental consulting, and then went into sales. While in my sales job I began
                dabbling with coding through on online program, and from there knew I wanted to pursue it full time!
            </p>

                In April this year I quit my job and backpacked solo around SE Asia to Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It was the most incredible
                experience of my life to date, but I know there will be many more like it to come! I love traveling and can't
                wait to have a career that allows me the finances and flexibility to travel regularly, but that's also interesting
                and challenging.
            </p>

                In my free time you can find me out and about with my pup, usually at Red Bud, Barton Springs, Zilker, or anywhere else with
                water. I also love to play volleyball, both sand and indoor, and regularly get in the gym to lift heavy sh*t.
